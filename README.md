# 🍻 Beer Production Forecasting 🚀
A machine learning model using LSTM for forecasting beer production trends based on historical data. Includes data preprocessing, EDA, and model training for accurate predictions.

## 📌 Description  
This project is a **Time Series Forecasting Model** built using Python to predict future beer production trends. It leverages an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network** trained on historical beer production data from Kaggle.

## 📌 Technologies Used  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow, Keras  

## 📌 Project Workflow  
1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing** – Loaded and cleaned the dataset, ensuring a proper date index.  
2️⃣ **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** – Visualized trends and seasonal patterns using decomposition techniques.  
3️⃣ **Feature Scaling** – Applied **MinMax Scaling** for better model performance.  
4️⃣ **Time Series Modeling** – Implemented an **LSTM neural network** to capture sequential dependencies.  
5️⃣ **Model Training** – Trained the model using **Keras-based LSTM** to predict future beer production values.  

## 📌 How to Run  
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.  
2. Install dependencies:  
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras  
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Beer Production Forecast.ipynb`).  
4. Run the notebook to train and test the model.
